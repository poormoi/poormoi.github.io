          Paintings of you<br>

          Papercut just above the eyes<br>
          Posing, perfect return to night<br>
          Sliding mountain around the cave<br>
          Past the tombs, out of sight<br>
          Graveyard picnic hypnotizing<br>
          Balloon sword gripping bloodful rising<br>

        <h3>Untitled poem 12</h3>
        <p>
          Ephestra: Boys and guillotine, come one and ghost. Harrowing grief, sorrowing guilt, and borrowing your copy of the Magna Carta.<br>
          <br>
          Hibiscus: Alas, you beseech mine joyful screechings. Relenting crumbling bubblable Fortune, protest in eclectic march a fortuitous mumble. A grumbling of treaties; and a morose dish of sweets.<br>
          <br>
          Ralph: In queer regard, I fawn toward neglection. Apparently shrieking in bloody direction – once apples fell keenly on Mother's eye, sleeping. So every gail freeing their jugular jail.<br>

        <h3>"Marigold" by Pinegrove</h3>
        <img style="max-width:50%;float:left;padding-right:2%;" alt="Marigold album cover" src="https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e1ced5e516bdd0008561e9d/1:1/w_600/pinegrove.jpg">
        <p>After several early independent releases, a solid breakout record in 2016 entitled <span class="italics">Cardinal</span>, a brief hiatus, and the 2018 release of the previously shelved <span class="italics">Skylight</span>, Pinegrove signed to the legendary UK label Rough Trade and released their third proper album <span class="italics">Marigold</span>, a tender stroll through the frosted grasses of the human condition.</p>
        <p>The record opens with “Dotted Line,” a mid-tempo country-style tune about pushing through life when it feels hopeless—a sentiment all too familiar to me, an Arizona emigrant trudging through his seventh Wisconsin winter. The lyric, sung by lead vocalist and songwriter Evan Stephens Hall,  returns in part to finish each verse, “May no memory hold my head up / Nor may no fantasy fold my head in,” urging a focus on the realities of the present and future in place of nostalgia and dreams of what could have been. As the narrator weaves through the cold Northeast (“Just another day in the polar vortex”), crossing into New Jersey, and staring at Manhattan in the distance, he reassures himself in the refrain: “I don't know how / But I'm thinkin' it'll all work out.” The climax is filled with a glorious three-voice chorus which the band belts out in shining optimism, hammering in the phrase four times.</p>
        <p>While “Dotted Line” is internal and self-reassuring, the subsequent 56-second epistolary “Spiral” is a sympathetic ode to another who suffers from the same emotional state. In four eight-line stanzas, divided into just three-syllable lines, Hall encourages good health (“Drink water / Good posture / Good lighting / Good evening) and repeats the comforting and uplifting “I see you,” an acknowledgment of their feelings and the pain that will pass.</p>
        <p>As always, Hall’s lyrics are clever and exquisitely patterned and his gentle drawl rests casually, yet precisely, atop the music; flowing­ in and out of time, soaring amid interlocking harmony and full-band soli. Unusually, however, the penultimate track “Neighbor,” a waltz-y ballad, decelerates into its final harmonic resolution and morphs into the album’s finale, the titular “Marigold,” a six-minute arhythmic drone which twinkles sweetly like a wind chime at the record’s dusk.</p>
        <p><span class="italics">Marigold</span> is available in vinyl, CD, cassette, and digital formats on Pinegrove’s <a href="https://pinegrove.bandcamp.com/album/marigold">Bandcamp page</a> or through Rough Trade Records.</p>

        <h3>"Y2K-9" by Todd Strasser</h3>
        <p>It’s not that I had high hopes for a kids chapter book about a crime-fighting, chatroom-lurking Labrador Retriever, but I was utterly appalled by how disappointing of a read <span class="italics">Y2K-9</span> turned out to be. With cliché, unrealistic dialogue and blatant, embarrassing pandering to children through the use of “cool” and “hip” turn-of-the-century internet slang, Todd Strasser has weaved together a dull frame of a story which was able to occasionally hold my attention only long enough to suffer through a chapter or two.</p>
        <p>The novel (a word I use simply because I assume that’s what it was intended it to be) follows Byte, a retired Animal Intelligence Agency operative and human pet, who is contacted for an urgent anti-terrorist mission by Lassie, Byte’s former case officer and current non-dog. PHLUSH, an anonymous group who communicate by magazine letter cut-outs, has threatened to send the country “down the drain” unless its demands are met. After a secret meeting with Lassie at the doggy doctor, Byte reluctantly accepts the job and enlists the help of his only three friends whom he knows solely through online chatrooms. He arranges an in-person meeting and to his surprise (not mine) Foxybabe, Buffhunk, and Richgurl each possess the opposite characteristics that their usernames suggest and are disgracefully under-qualified for a top secret intelligence mission. However, Byte realizes he has no other choice and starts work on finding the bad guys with his rag-tag, know-nothin’ team of losers by holing up in a crummy apartment, ordering takeout and researching who the bad guys might be by, I guess, Googling stuff?</p>
        <p>At this point during my torturous experience of reading this book, I realized I was already halfway through. My mind filled with panicked, exhausted thoughts: When will anything happen? Couldn’t these characters have been given some depth? Do I have to finish this? Amazingly, Todd “Pulitzer” Strasser, as I like to call him, ends up scrambling together an ending. The story ends in the way you’d expect. The team is at their breaking point and about to give up, but a convoluted combination of each of their “unique” talents is somehow enough to defeat the powerful mastermind behind the terrorist threats. All are congratulated and rewarded, Byte returns to his family, yadda yadda, blah blah blah. Oh yeah, did I mention his family’s surname is <span class="underline">Bark</span>ley?</p>
        <p>1/5 stars.</p>
