        <h2>"Marigold" by Pinegrove</h2>
        <p>After several early independent releases, a solid breakout record in 2016 entitled <span class="italics">Cardinal</span>, a brief hiatus, and the 2018 release of the previously shelved <span class="italics">Skylight</span>, Pinegrove signed to the legendary UK label Rough Trade and released their third proper album <span class="italics">Marigold</span>, a tender stroll through the frosted grasses of the human condition.</p>
        <img class="review" alt="Marigold album cover" src="https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e1ced5e516bdd0008561e9d/1:1/w_600/pinegrove.jpg">
        <p>The record opens with “Dotted Line,” a mid-tempo country-style tune about pushing through life when it feels hopeless—a sentiment all too familiar to me, an Arizona emigrant trudging through his seventh Wisconsin winter. The lyric, sung by lead vocalist and songwriter Evan Stephens Hall,  returns in part to finish each verse, “May no memory hold my head up / Nor may no fantasy fold my head in,” urging a focus on the realities of the present and future in place of nostalgia and dreams of what could have been. As the narrator weaves through the cold Northeast (“Just another day in the polar vortex”), crossing into New Jersey, and staring at Manhattan in the distance, he reassures himself in the refrain: “I don't know how / But I'm thinkin' it'll all work out.” The climax is filled with a glorious three-voice chorus which the band belts out in shining optimism, hammering in the phrase four times.</p>
        <p>While “Dotted Line” is internal and self-reassuring, the subsequent 56-second epistolary “Spiral” is a sympathetic ode to another who suffers from the same emotional state. In four eight-line stanzas, divided into just three-syllable lines, Hall encourages good health (“Drink water / Good posture / Good lighting / Good evening) and repeats the comforting and uplifting “I see you,” an acknowledgment of their feelings and the pain that will pass.</p>
        <p>As always, Hall’s lyrics are clever and exquisitely patterned and his gentle drawl rests casually, yet precisely, atop the music; flowing­ in and out of time, soaring amid interlocking harmony and full-band soli. Unusually, however, the penultimate track “Neighbor,” a waltz-y ballad, decelerates into its final harmonic resolution and morphs into the album’s finale, the titular “Marigold,” a six-minute arhythmic drone which twinkles sweetly like a wind chime at the record’s dusk.</p>
        <p><span class="italics">Marigold</span> is available in vinyl, CD, cassette, and digital formats on Pinegrove’s <a href="https://pinegrove.bandcamp.com/album/marigold">Bandcamp page</a> or through Rough Trade Records.</p>
